Hello Developer!

Thanks for downloading this code!

I have some notes for you:

1. Extract the files to your server directory
2. Create your database using PhpMyAdmin, database name is "php_oop_crud_level_1"
3. Import the SQL file called "php_oop_crud_level_1.sql" located in the "dev" folder.
4. You run index.php
5. You can ask me any PHP questions related to this code.
